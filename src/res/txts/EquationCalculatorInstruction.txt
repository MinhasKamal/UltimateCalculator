Equation Calculator Instruction:
This mode is made as simple as possible. You can find solution of four types of equations.


# Select equation type from the tabbed panes.

# Fill up all the input texts and press 'Solve' to solve.

# You can input any thing in those text fields but this mode supports only integer or floating type numbers.

# Try not input number having more than five digits, as it may result wrong answer or error.

# While working with third degree equation some times the calculator may not be able to provide specific answer (Because of not having single real root).


Note: Sometimes you may find result that is larger than the text pane's capability. Use your mouse pointer's selection feature to get to see the full result
